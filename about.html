        <p class="pmain">A FAA licensed drone pilot living and working in the Albany NY area. My business goal is to provide the best quality aerial mapping and imagery in the capital district. I continually push myself to know more and perform better. I make my home in East Greenbush with my wife, son and daughter. My other job is as a software application engineer. I enjoy mountain biking and funk, jazz and classical music.
