	  <h1>Matt Mangione</h1>
	  <p class="mainp">I am a FAA licensed drone pilot living and working in the Albany NY area. My professional goal is to provide the best quality aerial mapping and imagery
	  in the Capital District. I strive to know more and perform better by flying my drone and mapping as much as I can. I investigate the latest technology and
	  trends in drones and GIS. The links on this site are a reference for myself and I encourage you to check them out.</p>
	  <p class="mainp">I make my home in East Greenbush with my wife, son and daughter. My other job is as a software application engineer. I enjoy mountain biking and 
	  funk, jazz and classical music.</p>
