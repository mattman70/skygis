	  <h1>A look at three flight planning tools</h1>
	  <p class="mainp">There are three steps to making a decent drone map. First is capturing the data with the drone. Second is processing the captured images into a workable format. Last is finishing the processed data into a map that displays the spatial data in a meaningful way. In this article I will focus on performing the first step using three free flight planning and execution tools I have tried. </p>
	  <p class="mainp">The DroneDeploy app from DroneDeploy, PecisionFlight app from PrecisionHawk and Pix4Dcapture app from Pix4D are flight planning and execution tools that are free and available for Android and iOS devices. These apps provide a UI to draw an area for your flight, set parameters of the flight such as altitude and photo overlap etc., and autonomously fly the drone to capture the images for you. Below is a table of features a flight planner might provide indicating which of these features each app includes. I use the iOS version of these apps </p>
      <p class="mainp">How each presents the fly plan to you is slightly different so Iâ€™ll take a little deeper look at these first. 
	  </p>
      <h3> DroneDeploy UI</h3>
      <p class="mainp">What stands out about the DroneDeploy UI is that all settings are available from one screen. The advanced items such as photo overlap, custom camera setting and such are available in the Advanced dropdown. The other two apps require you to move to a settings screen to adjust these items. This leads me to belive for DroneDeploy each flight plan can have a separate set of advanced settings while in the other two apps the advanced settings are applied to all flight plans.</p>
