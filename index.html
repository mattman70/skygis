	  <h1>My first map</h1>
	  <p class="mainp">My first drone map was made June 2017. I had low/no expectations to the outcome but was very interested in how the technology of the drone, the photo 
	  stitching in DroneDeploy and at the end, importing it to MapInfo Pro would all work together. I used my newly purchased Phantom 3 and a free evaluation subscription to DroneDeploy. I planned the flight over my neighborhood making sure it would complete with one battery. The flight plan was 247 feet of altitude, 65% front and 75% side overlap, 34 mph speed and it covered about 33 acres. When I finally got through the pre-flight checks and pushed the Fly button I felt a twinge of excitement and fear as my drone took flight autonomously. I waited a day after uploading the captured data set to DroneDeploy to receive an email that my map was ready.</p>
	  <p class="mainp">When I logged in to DroneDeploy I was happy to see a decent resulting map. I emailed myself the completed map as a geo TIFF and imported it into
	  MapInfo Pro. I added a Bing tile layer under my drone map layer to add some context imagery outside the bounds of the drone map. Finally I put a scale bar
	  on the map and left like I had something like a completed project. Here is an image of that map.
