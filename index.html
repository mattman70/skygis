	  <h2>Matt Mangione and Sky-GIS</h2>
	  <p class="mainp">For 9 years I worked on the MapInfo Professional development team as a QA engineer. This time enhanced my affinity for geography and greatly deepened my knowledge and appreciation of GIS. In late 2016 I discovered the potential of drones for use in GIS, especially for making my own maps. By mid-2017 I was upgrading to my second drone and passed the sUAS pilot test exam. Now I am making a business of drone services specialized in aerial mapping. My professional goal is to provide the best aerial mapping in the Capital District and hopefully grow large enough to be able to make it my career. In the meantime I fly and map as much as time and the weather allows. As I studied for the remote pilot licensing exam I was impressed with the importance of safety when flying a drone. I realize it is an aircraft and have developed my own pre-flight procedures to avoid flight incidents. I also log each flight to keep records of my equipment usage and my personal flight time. I pride myself on being a drone pilot that operates in a safe manner that promotes a positive image of the drone community.</p>
      <p class="mainp">I currently fly a DJI Phantom 4 Pro and use DroneDeploy and PrecisionHawk to do my photo processing. I use MapInfo Professional for the majority of my desktop GIS work and have started to learn QGIS as an option that works on OS X.</p>
      <p class="mainp">The links on this site are references I use myself and I encourage you to check them out. I also encourage anyone with either a professional or recreational drone use question to contact me. I look forward to posting some technical drone and GIS related articles in the next few weeks.</p>
