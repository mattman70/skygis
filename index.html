	  <h1>My first map</h1>
	  <p class="mainp">My first drone map was made June 2017. I had low/no expectations to the outcome but was very interested in how the technology of the drone, the photo 
	  stitching in DroneDeploy and at the end MapInfo Pro would all work together. I used my newly purchased Phantom 3 and a free evaluation subscription to DroneDeploy. I planned the flight over 
	  my neighborhood making sure it would complete with one battery. The flight plan was 247 feet of altitude, 65% front and 75% side overlap, 34 mph speed and it covered
	  about 33 acres. When I finally got through the pre-flight checks and pushed the Fly button I felt a twinge of excitement/fear as my drone took flight autonomously. I waited
	  a day after uploading the captured data set to DroneDeploy to receive an email that my map was ready.</p>
	  <p class="mainp">When I logged in to DroneDeploy I was happy to see a decent resulting map. I emailed myself the completed map as a geo TIFF and imported it into
	  MapInfo Pro. I added a Bing tile layer under my drone map layer to add some context imagery outside the bounds of the drone map. Finally I put a scale bar
	  on the map and left like I had something like a completed project. Here is an image of that map.
